            <h1><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt">The Undernet 
            Coders Committee</span></h1>
            <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction and 
            definitions</a>.</h2>
            <p>This document describes how the Undernet's 
            coder committee should work. The formal procedures 
            it uses, the position of the people it is composed 
            of, and the tasks it should accomplish. Once 
            approved by the Undernet admins, this will become 
            the reference set of rules used by the committee.</p>
            <h3><a name="tasks">Tasks</a></h3>
            <p>The Undernet Coder Committee (hereafter called 
            coder-com or simply 'the committee') is in charge 
            of maintaining, debugging, upgrading, and 
            improving the code of the Undernet's server, 
            including protocol used for server-server 
            communication and for client-server communication, 
            the code related to additional services linked as 
            different daemons where it is considered desirable 
            by the Undernet admins, and the documentation of 
            all the above.</p>
            <p>It is formally accepted that any material (code 
            and documentation) produced by the committee has 
            to be released under the GNU General Public 
            License. What is not GPL is beyond the scope of 
            coder-com and is released and maintained 
            elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Similarly, it must be clear that while anything 
            developed by the committee is GPL and so anyone 
            (including individuals and other networks) is 
            welcome to use it for anything acceptable under 
            the license, the main scope of the committee is to 
            develop the code for the Undernet network, so only 
            those changes, features, or services used by the 
            Undernet network are part of the work of the 
            committee.</p>
            <h3><a name="goals">Goals</a></h3>
            <p>The major goals of the committee are (in 
            descending order of priority):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Diagnosing and removing bugs in the current 
              code. </li>
              <li>Improving the performances of the server 
              code used for Undernet. </li>
              <li>Making the codebase more stable, more 
              consistent, and more maintainable. </li>
              <li>Documenting both existing and newly written 
              code. </li>
              <li>Adding services and features while keeping 
              backwards compatibility with existing servers, 
              clients, and formal or informal standards. </li>
              <li>Developing new features for client use in 
              cooperation with the developers of other major 
              networks' and the developers of the major IRC 
              clients. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="members">Members</a></h2>
            <p>The committee has different kinds of members 
            with different roles: a maintainer, a secretary, a 
            small group of senior coders, and a larger group 
            of helpers.</p>
            <h3>The <a name="maintainer">maintainer</a></h3>
            <p>The maintainer is the one responsible for 
            keeping the integrity of the codebase. He or she 
            (hereafter labeled "he" for brevity, not sexism) 
            must be a very experienced coder and know the 
            internals of the server in detail.</p>
            <p>The maintainer is the only one who has direct 
            shell access to CVS and is responsible for 
            maintaining and administering the archive. It is 
            one of his major duties to keep things in sync and 
            verify that any change doesn't break the code or 
            the protocol.</p>
            <p>Most of the scope of the organization of 
            coder-com is the attempt to reduce the workload on 
            the maintainer by distributing what can be 
            delegated to others.</p>
            <p>The maintainer is a voting member of coder-com, 
            his vote prevails in case of a tie in a formal 
            call for votes, and his decisions about the actual 
            coding matters take place with a "silent 
            agreement" procedure as long as there are no 
            objections, and temporarily hold if a formal vote 
            is later held.</p>
            <h3>The <a name="secretary">secretary</a></h3>
            <p>The secretary basically has two tasks: working 
            as a liason&nbsp; between the coder committee and the 
            Undernet admins and keeping track of the formal 
            issues related to the application of this document 
            (issuing calls for votes, counting votes, and 
            formalizing decisions).</p>
            <p>The secretary doesn't need to be a coder, and 
            it is preferable that he or she be an admin that 
            volunteers for this task, in order to more easily 
            establish a communication between the admins and 
            the coder committee.</p>
            <p>Since the secretary is not a coder, he has no 
            voting rights on the committee.</p>
            <p>Basically while the maintainer maintains the 
            actual code (and has write access on the CVS tree 
            and direct power of decision on the actions that 
            regard it) the secretary maintains the lists (and 
            has direct access to the memberships on the lists) 
            and the committee itself.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>No voting member of coder-com may also serve as 
            secretary.</p>
            <h3><a name="senior">Senior</a> coders</h3>
            <p>Senior coders are the most experienced and 
            trusted coders that put the biggest effort into 
            ircu development. They are the only voting members 
            of the coder committee, and have write access to 
            the cvs archives. The maintainer is implicitly a 
            senior coder.</p>
            <h3><a name="helpers">Helpers</a></h3>
            <p>Everyone willing to contribute to the work of 
            the committee can be a helper simply by 
            subscribing to coder-com@, which will be an open 
            list.</p>
            <p>Subscription to coders@ is open for "lurking" 
            on the list but follows a slightly slower process 
            in order to keep out troublemakers. Only those who 
            have been removed from the list or those who are 
            strongly objected to by senior coders will not be 
            allowed to subscribe.</p>
            <p>Helpers usually do not have posting access to 
            the coders@ list nor read access to the bugs@ 
            list, and they can't submit patches directly to 
            the maintainer. Instead, they must follow the 
            specific procedure described below to do it, in 
            order to save some of the maintainer's time when 
            checking in patches.</p>
            <p>Tasks of the helpers include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Trying to help those who have trouble 
              running or compiling the daemon and answering 
              the easier questions asked on coder-com@. </li>
              <li>Replying to those who make fuzzy 
              feature-requests on coder-com and eventually 
              trying to interpret such requests and find out 
              if/how they can become realistic proposals for 
              code changes. </li>
              <li>Working on the documentation of the code.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A helper can be given access to posting to 
            coders@ and/or read access on bugs@, after 
            recommendation by a senior coder, and that would 
            happen after an informal vote, pending no 
            objections by other senior coders.</p>
            <h2><a name="mailing">Mailing</a> Lists</h2>
            <p>As a means of communication between the 
            members, the committee will use a few lists. An 
            open list like coder-com becomes too noisy and 
            tends to degenerate to flames too often to be the 
            most proper place for cooperatively discussing the 
            changes to the codebase, however, this list will 
            stay open and other discussion forums will be used 
            alongside it. Thus the work of the coder committee 
            will happen mainly on 4 discussion lists:</p>
            <h3>
            <a href="mailto:coder-com@undernet.org" name="coder-comlist">
            Coder-com@undernet.org</a></h3>
            <p>This remains a list open for both subscription 
            and posting where people can ask for help about 
            ircu and even non-coders can make requests or 
            proposals for features and changes. Announcements 
            about vote results, formal releases, and so on 
            should take place here.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The secretary, when asked to with an informal 
            vote by the senior coders, can remove 
            troublemakers from this list if they continuously 
            cause problems on the list without contributing 
            anything productive.</p>
            <h3>
            <a href="mailto:coders@undernet.org" name="coderlist">
            Coders@undernet.org</a></h3>
            <p>This is a partially closed list where the 
            senior coders can discuss the changes to the 
            codebase, make informal votes, and so on.</p>
            <p>The list is directly managed by the secretary.</p>
            <p>Helpers can subscribe to the list, and the 
            secretary will post weekly summaries of those 
            wanting to subscribe. If there are no objections 
            by senior coders, those wanting to subscribe will 
            be allowed to.</p>
            <p>If the secretary wishes, other lists may be 
            created with specific functions, like coders-cfv 
            used by the secretary to distribute the call for 
            votes only to voting members, and coders-votes to 
            collect and process them. However, these lists 
            will not be places of discussion.</p>
            <h3>
            <a href="mailto:bugs@undernet.org" name="bugslist">
            Bugs@undernet.org</a></h3>
            <p>This list is, and has always been, the place to 
            report bugs in the codebase. Here the senior 
            coders might also discuss how to deal with the 
            most critical bugs.</p>
            <p>The list is directly managed by the secretary.</p>
            <p>Only the secretary, the senior coders, and 
            those trusted helpers that have been authorized by 
            an informal vote may be subscribed to this list.</p>
            <p>The list is open for posting by anyone, except 
            troublemakers who have been labeled with "taboo 
            headers" or something similar.</p>
            <h3>
            <a href="mailto:patches@undernet.org" name="patcheslist">
            Patches@undernet.org</a></h3>
            <p>This list should carry only robogenerated 
            traffic, that is, only when the maintainer checks 
            in a patch on the CVS a message should be 
            automatically generated on this list with the 
            actual patch in diff-rc3 format and its 
            description.</p>
            <p>The list should be open for subscription to 
            anybody, but nobody should be allowed to post.</p>
            <p>As a temporary solution the stuff posted to 
            this list by humans is forwarded to the 
            maintainer, but he might find it preferable to 
            create some parallel support lists (like patches-checkin@ 
            for patches to be checked in, which would be open 
            for posting to trusted helpers and senior coders 
            and readable only from the maintainer himself, 
            patches-announce@ generated automatically by the 
            CVS with only the description of the patches 
            checked in by the maintainer for the coders that 
            use CVS to get the stuff and thus don't need to 
            subscribe to patches@.</p>
            <h2><a name="procedures">Procedures</a></h2>
            <p>Procedures for the tasks of the committee 
            should be kept as simple and informal as possible, 
            however, a minimum number of organizational 
            details and formalities are needed to keep 
            control.</p>
            <p>Any decision taken by the coder committee 
            follows one of these three paths: silent 
            agreement, informal voting, or formal voting. The 
            idea is that if there are not severe objections 
            for something, it can be decided with silent 
            agreement (that is, agreement is not reached if 
            there are any objections). If some objection 
            arises, an informal voting is asked by the 
            maintainer on the closed coders@ list, and only as 
            a last resort and/or for really major decisions 
            the secretary may issue a formal cfv.</p>
            <p>Moreover, most common actions of the committee 
            should follow a defined procedural path, thought 
            to simplify things and improve the stability of 
            the code produced, its consistency, and the 
            cooperation within the group.</p>
            <p>The procedures for common tasks are described 
            below, and following that are the descriptions of 
            the procedures and exact definitions of "silent 
            agreement," "formal voting," and "informal 
            voting".</p>
            <h3><a name="membernomination">Nomination of 
            members</a></h3>
            <p>Anyone can be a "helper" of the committee, just 
            by subscribing to coder-com and contributing 
            somehow (unless he manages to be removed from the 
            list), thus a procedure for becoming a helper 
            doesn't really exist.</p>
            <p>The procedure for removing someone from 
            coder-com in case he proves to be a troublemaker 
            is formalized as follows: with request or proposal 
            of one of the senior coders, a formal cfv is 
            issued by the secretary, and if it passes, the 
            subscription of the troublemaker to coder-com is

            <h4><a name="nomsenior">Nomination of senior 
            coders</a></h4>
            <p>Senior coders are those who are extremely 
            confident with the codebase internals, have proven 
            to be productive in terms of patches and actual 
            contributions to the code, are trusted by the 
            admins, and have proven to be capable of 
            cooperatively working together with the rest of 
            the group.</p>
            <p>The core group constituted&nbsp; by the senior 
            coders must be kept small, and the only thing that 
            any helper cannot do is vote on the critical 
            decisions of coder-com, thus someone definitely 
            does not need to be a senior coder to contribute 
            to Undernet's server.</p>
            <p>If one of the helpers has been contributing so 
            effectively to the committee to be considered 
            eligible to become a part of this core group, then 
            one of the senior coders should submit a proposal 
            nominating this person. Thereafter a formal vote 
            takes place among senior coders. If the result of 
            this cfv is positive then the secretary forwards 
            it to the Undernet admins list where they will 
            ratify the decision. Only after the decision has 
            been ratified by formal votes on both the coder 
            committee and the admins will a new senior coder 
            be added.</p>
            <p>The senior coders can be removed by the group 
            only by decisions of Undernet admins, and should 
            such a cfv on admins take place, the secretary of 
            coder-com suspends the voting rights of that 
            memeber on coder-com. Any of the senior coders can 
            send a request to remove another trusted coder 
            (with just case, of course) by sending a request 
            to the secretary. The secretary then forwards the 
            request to admins and waits for their decision.</p>
            <h4><a name="nommaintainer">Nomination of the 
            maintainer</a></h4>
            <p>The maintainer is elected by the Undernet 
            admins with a proposal made by the coders 
            committee itself and stays in duty for one year. 
            Should the term of one year happen to fall close 
            to the deadline for a new major release of the 
            server's code, the committee can decide to extend 
            the term of the existing maintainer until after 
            the formal release.</p>
            <p>When a new maintainer is to be elected, any of 
            the senior coders can volunteer himself for the 
            task. The secretary will forward a list of all 
            candidates to Undernet admins which following 
            their usual procedures will elect a new 
            maintainer.</p>
            <h4><a name="nomsecretary">Nomination of the 
            secretary</a></h4>
            <p>The secretary is nominated directly by the 
            Undernet admins, with the usual nomination and 
            voting procedures used for the secretaries of the 
            other committees.</p>
            <p>Once nominated he is in charge for one year, 
            unless he resigns or a decision of the admins 
            removes him before the term is over.</p>
            <p>As stated before the secretary doesn't actually 
            need to be a coder, and cannot be a senior coder, 
            but he should be a member of admins and coder-com.</p>
            <h3><a name="voting">Voting</a></h3>
            <p>Here are the descriptions of the voting 
            procedures for the committee:</p>
            <h4><a name="silent">Silent agreement</a></h4>
            <p>For quick decisions any senior coder can 
            propose a solution on the coders@ list. Should the 
            proposal regard the actual code the maintainer can 
            decide to accept the proposal immediately and 
            apply it, or he can choose to wait four days 
            before implementation. If the proposal regards 
            membership on the committee or the lists (or 
            something else non-code related) the secretary 
            will wait four days before acting on the proposal.</p>
            <p>These four days will be used to allow time for 
            objections or discussion by the senior coders.</p>
            <p>If no objections arise, the decision takes 
            place immediately, but if one or more objections 
            arise the maintainer (for what is pertinent to the 
            actual code) or the secretary (for the rest) asks 
            for an informal vote on the list.</p>
            <h4><a name="quick">Quick informal voting</a></h4>
            <p>Informal vote takes place publicly on the 
            coders@ list without special formalities.</p>
            <p>Who is in charge for the task (the maintainer 
            when it's about the actual code or the secretary 
            when it's about list membership and similar 
            problems) calls for the vote on the public list, 
            then the senior coders have six days to publicly 
            vote. After the sixth day or when the votes 
            collected determine the outcome, the person who 
            issued the informal cfv collects the votes and 
            acts on the outcome.</p>
            <h4><a name="formal">Formal</a> voting</h4>
            <p>Major decisions of the committee require a 
            formal vote, and these include: decisions proposed 
            by any of the senior coders like the nomination of 
            a new member for bugs, the nomination of a new 
            senior coder, a change in the server-server 
            protocol, a major change in the client-server 
            protocol (see below) and so on. Decision proposed 
            by the maintainer like major formal releases, 
            major design changes, and so on also require 
            formal cfvs.</p>
            <p>A formal cfv is always taken care of by the 
            secretary, who mails an official call for votes to 
            the senior coders. The senior coders then mail 
            back privately to the secretary their votes.</p>
            <p>The formal call for votes has a voting period 
            of seven calendar days, and it cannot be placed 
            across major holidays. To be valid at least 50% +1 
            of those having voting rights must have voted or 
            explicitly abstained. Someone who misses more than 
            two consecutive votes has his voting rights 
            suspended for the next two votes unless he is the 
            maintainer.</p>
            <p>In case the quorom is reached and the number of 
            votes for "yes" and "no" is exactly equal, the 
            vote of the maintainer is counted twice (and the 
            secretary publishes on the list only the modified 
            total count of votes, so as to not disclose the 
            maintainer's vote). If the maintainer didn't vote 
            or abstained, the secretary will inform him 
            privately of this result and give him another 
            chance to vote within 48 hours before letting the 
            cfv go void.</p>
            <h3><a name="patchapproval">Approval of patches</a></h3>
            <p>Patches can be submitted by anybody, but the 
            path they follow before being approved changes 
            based on who proposes them.</p>
            <p>Patches are those code submissions that don't 
            severely alter the "behavior" of the server but 
            only how it internally works; major changes follow 
            a different procedure described later.</p>
            <p>A patch must be submitted with a separate 
            description section that include standard header 
            fields, and the actual patch should be in 
            "diff-rc3" format. The maintainer can ask that the 
            description of the patch and other information are 
            provided in a standard form that can be somehow 
            automatically processed and archived, if he so 
            chooses.</p>
            <p>When a patch is prepared by one of the senior 
            coders or from one of the trusted helpers, he can 
            send it directly to the maintainer or, preferrably, 
            send it to the coders@ list (and it is advisable 
            that he let the coders@ list know what he is up to
            <b>before</b> writing the patch). The maintainer 
            should quickly verify it and then follow one of 
            the following three steps. If the patch seems ok 
            to him he puts it in the repository, and the 
            senior coders can eventually object to it and ask 
            for an informal voting. Otherwise, the maintainer 
            could have found some problem with the patch, in 
            which case he can either discuss privately the 
            issue with the author until they find an agreement 
            or ask for an informal vote on the list while 
            keeping the patch suspended.</p>
            <p>Finally, when a patch is submitted by a helper 
            he has to contact first one of the senior coders, 
            who will act as a "sponsor" for the patch and has 
            the duty of verifying its behavior, personally 
            testing it, checking for interference with other 
            parts of the code, and fixing problems. If he 
            finds the patch working and helpful, he posts it 
            as "written by x, verified by me." This is to save 
            the maintainer from the work of checking patches 
            that are broken, unacceptable, or that break the 
            protocol of the choices made by coder-com or 
            admins.</p>
            <p>Helpers that have been given posting access to 
            coders@, can send patches they want to propose 
            directly on the list, so that the maintainer can 
            check them directly, but discussing and testing 
            the patches together with one of the senior coders 
            might be a good idea anyway.</p>
            <h3><a name="approvalformal">Approval of formal 
            releases</a></h3>
            <p>The coding tasks of the committee move toward 
            two different directions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Preparation of new releases </li>
              <li>Bug fixing </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All optimization efforts, addition of new 
            features, and protocol changes should be 
            considered part of the "next major release". Thus 
            the CVS should be divided into two branches: a 
            stable working release and an "experimental" 
            unstable release.</p>
            <p>Most patches should be included only in the 
            experimental source tree. When the experimental 
            source tree has been found stable it can be 
            formally released as stable.</p>
            <p>Upon proposal by the maintainer, a formal vote 
            takes place to make the current "experimental" the 
            next stable formal release, and following that the 
            maintainer prepares a tarball of the release to be 
            submitted to admins that will become the 
            "required" codebase for Undernet servers. Thus all 
            patches included in the CVS should <b>not</b> be 
            adopted in the network until the next formal 
            release has been produced and approved.</p>
            <p>An exceptional path is to be adopted for bug 
            fixes considered urgent in the production network. 
            When such a bug is found and a patch is prepared 
            for it, the maintainers will post two different 
            patches: one for the "experimental" tree and one 
            for the "production" tree. The patch on the 
            production tree should be applied as soon as 
            possible by all the servers on the production 
            network to fix the bug while waiting for the next 
            formal release.</p>
            <p>Upon informal voting on admins and pending the 
            approval of the maintainer and no objections from 
            the admins, some servers can volunteer to test the 
            "experimental" source tree on the production 
            network, but giving complete availability to help 
            fix eventual problems by giving a shell to the 
            senior coders that request it, and being ready to 
            immediately apply any patch/change requested by 
            coder-com. These servers should be willing to 
            downgrade to the last "stable" source tree if any 
            problem arises that can't be immediately solved.</p>
            <h3><a name="approvalsemantic">Approval of 
            protocol/semantic changes</a></h3>
            <p>Some changes in the source tree can't be done 
            with simple patches because they have a major 
            impact on the network, and the following are 
            examples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Changes to the server-server protocol's 
              syntax or semantics </li>
              <li>Changes in the client-server protocol that 
              can break existing clients (like the removal of 
              commands or the change of their behavior that 
              cause any command that worked and produced a 
              given effect with some parameters to behave 
              differently or not work anymore with the same 
              parameters and under the same conditions) </li>
              <li>Addition of commands of features that might 
              somehow violate any of the rules of the network 
              (like allowing people to spam more, to have 
              access to information they couldn't access 
              before, to hide information that they couldn't 
              hide before and so on) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Such changes need to be approved by a formal 
            vote on coder-com and then forwarded for 
            ratification to admins.</p>
            <p>Moreover changes in server-server protocol 
            should always be checked in advance with the 
            coders/maintainers of the services linked to the 
            network, and as far as possible changes in the 
            client-server protocol should always be checked in 
            advance with the coders of the major clients and 
            of the daemons of the other major networks. On 
            this last subject Undernet will make any effort to 
            promote cooperation with the coders of other major 
            networks and of the most commonly used clients.</p>
