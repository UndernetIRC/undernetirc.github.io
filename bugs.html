        <h2>Reporting Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p>
            In order for the team to best address critical security vulnerabilities, we ask that you email 
            <a href="mailto:bugs@undernet.org">bugs@undernet.org</a> to let us release a patch prior to disclosure. This ensures that 
            users within the community have a chance to apply appropriate software patches and upgrades prior to potential exploits being widely available.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event that you are also submitting a patch for a vulnerability, we ask that you create an appropriate pull request on the GitHub project repository and email 
            <a href="mailto:bugs@undernet.org">bugs@undernet.org</a> with details and a link to the pull request.
